Cyberoam PyQt Client
===================
Version: 0.6
Licence: GPLv3

A cyberoam gui client build using PyQt primarily for use on linux systems. though it can also run on Windows :)

Requirements:
* python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/getit): 
    It is usually installed on *nix systems by default
* pyqt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download/):
    Ubuntu users can install it by running `apt-get install python-qt4`

I have tested it on Ubuntu (KDE and Unity), and Windows 7

To use, just run `python cyberoam.py`

Limitations:
* Needs a terminal tab open for it to be running.
* Have not really worked on the layout. It needs refining. Volunteers anyone?

I am planning to create an installer sometime. :)
