Cyberoam PyQt Client v0.5
=========================
Licence: GPLv3

A cyberoam gui client build using PyQt primarily for use on linux systems. :)

Requirements:
* python 2.7
* pyqt4

To use, just run `python cyberoam.py`

Limitations:
* Needs a terminal tab open for it to be running.
* Have not really worked on the layout. It needs refining. Volunteers anyone?

I am planning to create an installer soon. :)
